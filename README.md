## ðŸŽ® Try It Live

Test the library in your browser with our [interactive WebGL demo](https://jwho303.itch.io/vfx-library).

- **Drag the black orbs** to reshape and redirect the visual effects
- **Toggle effects on/off** using the checkboxes
- Experiment with different combinations to see what's possible

## âœ¨ Features

- **Path-Based Visual Effects**: Create stunning effects that follow paths with intuitive controls
- **10+ Path Types**: Wave, Lightning, Vortex, Noise, Organic Wave, Bounce, Arc, ZigZag, and more
- **Multiple Render Options**: Particle systems, line renderers, and sprite sheet animations
- **Interactive & Dynamic**: Easily create responsive effects that react to gameplay events
- **Full Source Code Access**: Extend and customize to fit your specific needs
- **Editor Visualization**: Robust gizmo system for easy setup and debugging
- **Optimized Performance**: Designed with efficiency in mind for mobile and low-end devices

## ðŸ“± Mobile Performance

This library is specifically designed to work well on mobile devices, including low-end hardware. The video below demonstrates the VFX demo scene running on a Xiaomi Redmi 9A (MediaTek Helio G25, 2GB RAM) at a consistent 30 FPS.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

The library is built around three core components that work together:

### VFXController

The central manager class that controls and coordinates visual effects. It:
- Handles a collection of VFX elements
- Manages path points that define effect trajectories
- Controls the lifecycle (initialize, play, stop) of all attached effects
- Provides editor visualization through gizmos

### BaseVFXElement

The rendering component that visualizes effects along the path. Derived classes include:
- `LineRendererElement`: Renders effects using Unity's LineRenderer
- `ParticleElement`: Uses particle systems to visualize effects
- `SpriteSheetParticleElement`: Extends particle effects with sprite sheet animations

Each element handles its specific rendering approach while following the common path.

### BaseVFXPath

The mathematical component that calculates positions along a path. Derived classes include various path types:
- Linear paths (straight lines)
- Curved paths (arcs, waves)
- Dynamic paths (lightning, noise, organic)
- Compound paths (blended paths)

This separation of concerns allows you to mix and match different path algorithms with different rendering methods to create diverse effects.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Import the package into your Unity project
3. Explore the example scene to understand the components
4. Create a new GameObject and add a `VFXController` component
5. Add your choice of VFX elements and path calculators
6. Configure the path points and play the effect
